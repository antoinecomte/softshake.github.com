Fragmentation on the Android platform comes in several flavors.
Mobile devices in the wild can differ on their installed Android version, their screen size/resolution and their supported hardware features.
With the advent of Android tablets the platform adds a new class of supported hardware to its portfolio.

The workshop addresses all types of fragmentation with a focus on UI design and the new fragments API.
