Mobile smart devices (aka smart phones) have taken the world by stom. As more an more devices are being activated,
more applications need to be written for those devices.
Even though iOS is dominant, other players are making inroads and need software as well.
Developing native apps for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Web OS and Nokia is an expensive proposition however.
Thankfully, there is HTML5 and JavaScript, which are supported on all mobile operating systems.

This sessions shows how to develop a "native looking" application that can be installed through the various app stores
like a native application, but written entirely in HTML5 and CSS.
Using frameworks like jQuery mobile or Sencha and tying everything together with PhoneGap,
it is possible to develop cross plattform native mobile applications."
