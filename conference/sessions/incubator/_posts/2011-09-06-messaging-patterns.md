RabbitMQ is emerging as good solution for open source messaging in modern architectures. This opens new challenges on how to implement integration patterns in order to go beyond simple produce/consume applications. In this presentation we will show how to implement several messaging patterns using RabbitMQ as backend technology such as:

- Competing consumers
- RPC
- Parallel RPC
- Smart Proxy
- Publish/Subscribe

The examples will be given in Erlang.
