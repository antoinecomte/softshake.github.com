Infinispan is an open source caching and data grid platform from Red Hat. In this talk, Galder will provide a beginners guide to Infinispan, touching on the key problems that Infinispan solves such as the need to cache data (Data Caching) or using Infinispan as an authoritative source of data (Data Grid). 

Clustering data structures is important to provide the scalability and failover capabilities needed by modern applications, and so the talk will explain the techniques used to share data and what impact it has depending on the use case. On top of that, the audience will learn how popular frameworks are benefiting from integrating Infinispan such as Hibernate where Infinispan powers a low-latency second level cache. Since this is a 'for Dummies' talk, it will be full of easy-to-understand explanations, tear-out cheat sheets...etc.
