Java has a reputation for boilerplate code: ubiquitous getters and setters, a verbose anonymous class syntax,
and redundant declarations to name a few. It doesn't have to be this way!
There are many ways to bust the boilerplate and this session provides a solid understanding of the most modern techniques.

Come learn about inversion of control idioms, Proxy objects, code generation tools, and the latest libraries that both
create and manage boilerplate code so you don't have to. A leaner, meaner codebase is yours for the taking.
