"The Pragmatic Programmer" admonished us all to "write code that writes code": use code generators to increase productivity and avoid duplication.
Today's language communities have clearly caught on, as more and more frameworks generate code at compile time:
AST Transforms, Project Lombok, Spring Roo, Contracts for Java, Spock, GContracts, Groovy++, and more.

This session reviews these approaches including examples of how and why we'd want to do this.
Come see the newest Groovy language tools, look in-depth at production deployed AST Transforms,
and view libraries based on these techniques.

Audience: developers searching for cutting edge solutions to increasing team velocity.
