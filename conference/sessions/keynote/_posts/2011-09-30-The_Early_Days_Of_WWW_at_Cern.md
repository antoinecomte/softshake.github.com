The WWW system came into existence in 1989-1990 at CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics located near Geneva, on the Swiss-
French border, and was further developed there until 1995; THE GOAL:
connect all the technical documents related to the LHC (Large Hadron
Collider) project, both accelerator and experiments, where thousands
of scientists, engineers and technicians scattered at hundreds of
locations on the face of the planet are currently involved; THE
SOLUTION: hypertext on the internet;

The web, now a very popular service on the internet and widely used
well beyond its original scope, was invented by Tim Berners-Lee and
developed at CERN by a small team until it grew too big for the scope
of the laboratory and was put in the public domain; the speaker has
witnessed from close-by the birth of the idea and its development in
the early days, acting as a facilitator and resource provider;

Early documents related to this amazing adventure will be presented,
together with personal recollections and lessons learned.
