The cloud computing era is coming enabling us to create more complex and powerful solutions integrating on-premises
and cloud platforms in mixed environments.
New challenges must be faced from a software development management perspective:
* How is possible to manage complex projects integrating different technologies (Azure, .Net, Enterprise Java)?
* How to manage the integration of so many different projects, meeting quality expectations and deploying applications to different environments?
* How to keep track of the effectiveness and productivity of the development teams?
* How we can do that in an agile way?

Team Foundation Server 2010 is the Application Lifecycle Management platform from Microsoft that provides
all the capabilities needed to face the challenges of cloud software development.

In this session weâ€™ll see:
* The components of Team Foundation Server 2010
* Eclipse and Visual Studio integration
* Continuous Building with ANT/Maven
* Automatic deploy to the Cloud
