Jens-Christian started programming in the 80s of the last century and has continued to do so until now, still enjoying it,
learning new things every day and trying to learn a new language every year.
He's been doing web related stuff since the mid 90s. After working at various small and large corporations, he founded InVisible in 2001.
InVisible has been working with different web technologies, namely Ruby on Rails, JavaScript with stints into other areas and mobile development.

When he's not working, Jens-Christian is practicing Aikido and working on obtaining a Masters degree in Information Technology.
