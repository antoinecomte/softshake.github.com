Pieter Hintjens is a software designer, writer, and campaigner with 30 years' experience in the IT business. His speciality is the analysis and design of large-scale systems (both technical and social) through the mixture of top-down structural guidelines and bottom-up organic activity. Today, this generally means the building of large-scale IT architectures, and communities around open source and crowd organization principles.

Currently, he is benevolent dictator (together with Martin Sustrik) of the ZeroMQ (ØMQ) project, a high performance library for messaging and concurrency. ZeroMQ was built by iMatix Corporation, and then opened to an active community of open source contributors and developers. He is the author of ØMQ - The Guide, author of the czmq C binding, and maintainer of the official ZeroMQ packages.

From 2005-2007 he was the president of the the FFII, a European civil society association that works for a free information infrastructure. The FFII was instrumental in stopping the advance of software patents in Europe and has been a partner to industry and politicians in key areas of innovation policy. As president of the FFII, he launched the European Software Market Association and the European Patent Conference, a major convention of patent industry experts from Europe and the United States. EUPACO-2, in May 2007, assembled more than 30 international speakers.
