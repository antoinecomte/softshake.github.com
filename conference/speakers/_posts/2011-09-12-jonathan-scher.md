I’m a java developer. In 2007, we used eXtreme Programming in our team. It led to a huge success.
From then, I couldn’t stop using Agile practices in my daily work. And it spread naturally among every team I joined.
To spread it even faster, I help to organize huge Agile conferences each year: Agile Tour and Agile France.
I also created some trainings sessions.

My favorite practices are Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Frequent Deliveries.
Because it shortens the feedback loop, I strongly believe it helps developers to build quality softwares.

Lately, I've been involved in a lot of short projects. I had to bend every Agile practices for those projects,
and learn a few new practices...
