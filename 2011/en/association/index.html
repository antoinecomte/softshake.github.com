<h2>THE ORGANIZATION</h2>


<p>In order to guarantee an independence to any organization and any technology we have created a non-profit organization which has for goal to organize the event and manage the expenses.</p>

<p>To maintain a balance between the main technologies represented, the organization is divided into pairs, each having the responsibility for managing its track (agile, mobile devices, java and microsoft). The incubator track is managed by the entire organization.</p>
