During my 15 years in the software industry, I have had the opportunity to experience all phases of software development
and have contributed to the delivery of over 12 software systems.
I have occupied all roles in the software development process, both technical and managerial.

I am fluent in a number of development processes, from waterfall to agile.
I have also worked on various contract types, from research to firm fixed price as well as consultancy.
I take pride in delivering high quality systems, at the right level of functionality with relatively low complexity, at the right price.

I am also fluent in a number of software languages, platforms, environments and operating systems.
In the last five years, I have specialised in distributed computing, namely cloud and grid.
Agile and iterative development processes have also taken an increasing role in my ability to deliver incrementally to customers’ satisfaction,
in a manner sustainable for both my teams and customers.

Before becoming involved in distributed computing, I specialized in real-time system simulation and test-bed development in the space industry
