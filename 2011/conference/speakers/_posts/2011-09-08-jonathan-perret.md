Polyglot, test-infected, a regular at the Paris Coding Dojo, Jonathan is a programmer at heart.

He has been a software developer for more than 10 years, but reading “XP explained” in 2004 really changed
the way he looked at his work — and that was only the beginning.
Jonathan is always on the lookout for opportunities to live, share and teach the joy that programming brings.
