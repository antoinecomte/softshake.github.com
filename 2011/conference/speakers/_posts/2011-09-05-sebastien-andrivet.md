Sebastien is playing with computers since the beginning of '80s. After some (short) tentative with the BASIC language, he switched to 8-bit processor assembly programming. In the â€™90s, in parallel to studies in the University of Geneva, he specialized in C/C++ and assembly programming on Win/Intel and some Smalltalk. During the Internet years, he participated to several startups and releases some open source applications, including a multi-platform XML parser written in C++. At this time, he was confronted to software pirates and the incredible world of buffer overflows and SQL injections. In 2002, he specialized in applications security and forensics. As a fan of Apple since the famous Apple II and the legendary NeXT, he applies today his skills on iPhone and iPad.
