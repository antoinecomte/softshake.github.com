Programming is insanely hard. It’s discipline. It’s learning your code katas from inside out.
It’s overcoming fear that you might write something buggy in a piece of software that will cost its owner millions of dollars.
It is also fun, however. And while we do talk about it, we seldom do code for fun, just as a celebration of how much we love our coder’s life.

This session is an attempt to change this. We’re going to code for fun.
With the secret hope that some of the attendees will like what they’ll see,
decide it’s the coolest thing to do, and make it happen everywhere on the planet.
