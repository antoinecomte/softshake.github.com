Just a year after Windows Phone 7 was released to the market, Microsoft is updating the already widely popular platform
to a new release called “Mango”, which adds a lot of highly anticipated features, especially for developers.

This session will introduce you to what’s new in the Mango platform for you as a developer.
Many samples will show you the latest additions including background agents, the new on-device database,
how to make your application run in the background and how to create augmented-reality applications
or create multiple live tiles per application, that can be easily updated from within the running app.
