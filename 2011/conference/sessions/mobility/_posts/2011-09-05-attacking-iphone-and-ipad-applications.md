"Security is often neglected by developers, by lack of knowledge or because it is not anticipated. Sometimes security preoccupations begin very late in the project, sometimes even after the initial launch of the application. This is clearly contradictory to any Agile approach: security has to be taken into account from the beginning and during the whole life of a system.

We will demonstrate with real-life examples common security problems of iPhone and iPad applications and which measures to take to avoid them."
