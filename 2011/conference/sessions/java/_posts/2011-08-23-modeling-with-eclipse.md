Every developer uses models. Even when doing basic UI stuff, developers store data in some objects, that represent the business entity their application manages.
These simple beans are models. People are so used to manipulate models that we now speak more and more of Model-Driven Development and Model-Driven Architecture.
Models are now part of the common development landscape.

Eclipse provides a very huge, consistent and powerful set of tools to deal with Modeling.
Everything starts with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which is so powerful that more than 70 projects have born in the
Eclipse repositories to resolve common Modeling use-cases and issues on top of EMF!

In this presentation, you'll learn the basics of EMF and we will make a guided tour of the Modeling ecosystem at Eclipse,
with some demos of the most famous tools in the area.
