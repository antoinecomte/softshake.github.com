You've grown lazy and wasteful, and so have I.

In a world of Java and .NET managed code, we've forgotten what its like to work with constraints. Even mobile phone development is an exercise in luxury with megabytes of memory, and garbage collection making life easy.

In this presentation I'll share my experience and insights creating an Evernote client for the Pebble watch. How do you deal with writing code in C, with no malloc available? What do you do when the maximum message size between your phone and your watch is 120 bytes? What does it mean to create a useful app for your watch?

Wearable computing seems to be the Next Big Thing. Come to this presentation to get some early insights.
