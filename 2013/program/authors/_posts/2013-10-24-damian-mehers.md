Damian Mehers is a senior software engineer at Evernote, based out of Geneva, Switzerland. He created the Evernote windows phone client, and now helps build Evernote Food for android.

Prior to joining Evernote, Damian released an app he'd created in his spare time, which used Evernote's open API. They noticed, and he got a call from the CEO asking if he'd join the company to help build Evernote's next generation of products. It wasn't a hard decision.

He has founded and eventually sold several successful software product companies, and loves the magic that is programming: turning something imagined into something real.
