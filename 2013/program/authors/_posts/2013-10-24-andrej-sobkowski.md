Andrej simply makes things work. His career is dedicated to the management of enterprise software in international multi-cultural contexts and in multiple functional domains. He has worked in quite a few European countries and in North America, partnering with companies around the world (including offshore partners in India and Morocco).

His main domains of expertise are:
* Management: Sobkowski has managed departments of 50+ geographically-distributed resources and budgets of up to 10 M$. As a member of the executive team, he has been responsible for the definition and delivery of the corporate product roadmap and the establishment of executive partnerships.
* Project and program management: Andrej is a delivery-oriented person with a strong project culture, perfectly at ease with the scope – time – resources triangle as well as risk and quality management. He is a strong supporter of Agile methodologies (SCRUM in particular) and continuous integration whenever software is involved.
* Technology: a certified enterprise architect, Sobkowski is comfortable with Java/JEE and C#.NET environments as well as most of the acronyms and paradigms of the Information Technology industry.

Andrej holds a master’s degree in Computer Science Engineering from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications of Paris (France) – recently renamed “Télécom ParisTech”, a master’s degree in Electronics Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino (Italy) and an Executive MBA in Management and Corporate Finance from HEC Lausanne (Switzerland).

His current interests revolve around entrepreneurship and enterprise software applied to mobile applications and cloud computing (PAAS and SAAS in particular).
 
Andrej, an Italian and Canadian citizen, lives in France near the border with Switzerland with his wife and their 3 boys.
