Rémi likes programming, teaching and discovering things. That's why he became software engineer, researcher and associate professor. He is specialized in machine learning and computer vision. Aside his teaching and research position, he loves keeping up to date with new technologies ranging from web apps to mobile apps to gpu programming. He started hacking with browser-based presentations more than 7 years ago and is still doing it... but now with close to endless possibilities.
