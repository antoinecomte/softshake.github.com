Daniel Lobato is a developer who has worked in very different environments, from data centers and mainframes to startups. Nowadays he has dived into the Agile Infrastructure team at CERN where the design and implementation of the new computing infrastructure is done. As for Puppet, he currently helps RedHat and NASA to develop Foreman, a lifecycle management tool for physical and virtual machines. One of his goals at CERN is to knot this tool to all the relevant parts of the infrastructure, which includes Puppet for configuration management, Openstack for virtualization and authentication, Puppetdb and others. He is sure the source of all computer problems is between the chair and the keyboard.
