<p>Call for papers is open. The deadline for your submission is Sunday July 14th 2013.</p>

<p>Some precisions :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sessions are mainly in <a href="/2013/fr/cfp/">french</a>, or in English</li>
	<li>Every slot is one hour long. However a session can cover more than one slot.</li>
	<li>The speaker agrees to provide a PDF version of its material, in order to allow Soft-Shake.ch to provide it freely to the visitors of the conference.</li>
	<li>The speaker access freely to the whole conference. In case of a session with more than one speaker, only the main speaker is given a free pass.</li>
	<li>The tight budget of the conference prevents us to cover speakers travel expenses. We thank you in advance for your understanding.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding a particular track, please contact directly the track owners via the correct email specified above and using track-incubator@soft-shake.ch for the Incubator.<br/>
