<p>Call for papers is open. The deadline for your submission is Sunday July 14th 2013.</p>

<p>Some precisions :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sessions are mainly in <a href="/2013/fr/cfp/">french</a>, or in English</li>
	<li>Every slot is one hour long. However a session can cover more than one slot.</li>
	<li>The format of the session is free (academic, workshop, interactive ...): astonish your audience!</li>
	<li>The speaker agrees to provide a PDF version of its material, in order to allow Soft-Shake.ch to provide it freely to the visitors of the conference.</li>
	<li>The speaker access freely to the whole conference. In case of a session with more than one speaker, only the main speaker is given a free pass.</li>
	<li>The tight budget of the conference prevents us to cover speakers travel expenses. We thank you in advance for your understanding.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can submit sessions for any of the identified tracks :</p>
<ul>
<li>Agile (<a href="mailto:track-agile@soft-shake.ch">track-agile@soft-shake.ch</a>)</li>

<p>And you can also submit a session for the <b>Incubator</b> track which is meant to welcome every session that does not fit in another track. Do not hesitate to submit your session : as long as it concerns something related to software development (technologies, practices, methods...), there are no off-topic sessions !
