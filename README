Softshake's Website


h1. URLs : NO CONTENT OUTSIDE A YEAR

All HTML content has to be in a </YEAR/LG> directory.

For exemple, the association page for the 2013 edition has to be in the file `/2013/fr/association/index.html`.

This is to prevent several yearly editions.


h1. Technologies

h2. Github Pages

Workflow:

# Modify sources
# `git commit -m "Explanation of the modification"` 
# `git push" (to put modifications on the server)
#Â See online the modification !

You can also use the Github app : http://mac.github.com/ (or http://windows.github.com/)


h2. Markdowm (Text Templating)

Github Pages supporting Markdown as default text templating engine to facilitate development.

It is HTML compliant : 
* Or you can write full HTML code
* Or you can use Markdown synthax (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* Or both.


h2. Jekyll

As Github Pages uses Jekyll (a blog engine), our website too :

* `_config.yml` (aka configuration file)

How run locally (to test for example) :

# Install Ruby on rails
# `gem install jekyll`
# `jekyll serve` (from the softshake root source directory)
# `localhost:4000` (from your favorite browser)
