<h2>CONFERENCE 2011</h2>

After the success of the first edition, Soft Shake 2011 will be held on the 3rd and 4th october at <a href="http://www.geneva-palexpo.ch">Palexpo</a> in Geneva.
<p/>
We are expecting over 400 attendees english and french speaking.
<p/>
The conference was initiated by the Agile Tour Geneva team with a desire to reach out to other communities of people who would have never come to agile. This could not be done legitametely without the involvement of locals communities. That's why the original team has joined the iPhone Developer Group of Suisse Romande and the Geneva JUG (for the Java part).
<p/>
For each of these topics or tracks, we dedicate at least one room to ensure a perfect balance, a good representation and avoid the predominance of a theme. For this sencond year we identified four themes :
<ul>
<li>Agile</li>
<li>Mobile devices</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
</ul>

New for the 2011 edition we add a track on Microsoft technologies where you will be able to find all their latest innovations and their feedbacks.
<p/>
We also provide an incubator track in order to let speakers talk about any other IT subjects.
<p/>
Finally, we are going to dedicate an open space technology offering a relaxed and friendly format to explore more advanced topics covered during the conference.
<p/>
<p/>
One of those tracks inspires you ?!... Feel free to register as a speaker. Sessions can take various formats (workshop, feedbacks, state of the art, ...), different times in English or in French
<p/>
You are interesting with those topics ?!... See in you in October in Geneva.
