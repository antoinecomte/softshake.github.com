It ain’t sci-fi — personal robots are here! In this talk, we’ll take a tour of the new breed of sociable robots destined for the home, and talk about interactive application development for robots today. We’ll address questions such as: Why do robots need a humanoid form? What can they do for us? And of course, what could possibly be emotional about a robot? We’ll dive into the latest research about emotions, and suggest strategies for robots and other devices to bridge the gap and bring technology closer to humans.
