Do you want to build a cool iOS app to share your photos on Twitter, Facebook or Google+? If so, you will need to authenticate through OAuth2. Instead of using their own authentication schemes, most providers choose to implement OAuth2, the latest revision of the OAuth protocol. It gives users a secure way to talk to their services, but more importantly, allows users to safely authorize access to their data from third-party services without giving them their credentials.

If you think security topic is hard to tackle, join me in this live coding session. We'll delve deep into OAuth2 protocol and see the challenges to overcome from a native app perspective: embedded web view vs external browser, URL schema for callback, local storage for tokens, refresh access tokens transparently...

After this session, OAuth2 will have no secret to you!
